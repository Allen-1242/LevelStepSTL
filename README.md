# LevelStepSTL: Trend Fitting Algorithm

LevelStepSTL is a univariate trend fitting algorithm that automatically handles severe level shifts in the data. It is useful in smoothening highly erratic time series data. Can also be used for Anomaly Detection as the internal algorithm automaically handles anomalies.
